# Mars Rovers

Hi interviewer I did this project using hexagonal architecture, due I found it fascinating and helps a lot with maintainability issues, I also attached a UML diagram to show the structure (I created it using Intellij IDEA).


## Assumptions

    1 It only mentioned the limits of the plateau and that's it, so if the rover exceeds the limits should be count as lost

    2 also if the rover starts in a position out of the bounds counts as lost

    3 in case the coordinates where given in a bad way the rover will have the default position  0 0 N

## Comments

 it took me a bit longer than 3 hours (around 5) due I focus on the best practices using TDD and clean code then trying 
 to refactor some code, I think it will explain itself better than any comment that I can make.
